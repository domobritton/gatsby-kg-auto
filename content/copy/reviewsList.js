I never have to worry when I bring my car there, because I know that Kirill will take care of me, repair my car fast, and do the job right. Not only that but he is an honest man, and I would not trust my car (my baby) with anyone else. This is why I have been returning for service over the past 5+ years. KG Auto Repair is truly the best out there!',

        text: `Kirill (it's a Russian name) at KG Auto Repair is awesome! I live in Brookline, but I still drive all the way down to Lawrence for Kirill to work on my car. After checking out some mechanics in my area, I refuse to let anyone else touch my car but Kirill. They are always so fast at KG and really know their stuff. My whole family goes to KG and all our friends do as well. Everyone knows it's the best service and you can always trust the price. KG's is like the mom and pop shop of auto repair...if you want to leave your car in good hands and be worry free, you should definitely have Kirill as your mechanic.`,

He doesn't say that something needs to be fixed if it doesn't and that's a Rare find. Thank you Kirill for all your years of honest work.`,

I don't really know anything about cars and he didn't talk down to me or try to give me the run around. He identified my problem and we got it fixed right away and even had some advice for me when ordering tires on the internet. I'll definitely be heading back next time I need service, thanks KG!!`,

I like the atmosphere there and feel comfortable leaving my car in the hands of KG mechanics. I rather travel to Lawrence from Boston to get my car fixed than to go somewhere local! It really is a great shop and I would refer anyone to go check it out, especially if you are in the area!`,

Ivan was more than happy to show me around my car for the troubleshooting portion of the repair process; he covered a slew of things and did simple tests in order to pin-point the problem, all the while explaining every noise & function. The guy was also really flexible with my out-of-the-ordinary paying method (paying 90% of it w/ cash & credit card and the other 10% w/ a post-dated check). All-in-all this place was friendly and very quick. I highly suggest you see them first if you have car troubles.`,

He called for parts, and started to work on the car immediately, By the time the parts arrived, he was ready to install them - I was in and out in 2 hrs. with a problem fixed at a fair price. I will definitely go there again.`,

        text: `I'm always nervous when getting auto repair done because I know so little about cars. But these guys at K&G really changed that for me. They explained to me what work they were going to do, how they were going to do it, and exactly what it would cost me. And here's the amazing part, they did EXACTLY what they said and charged me EXACTLY what they quoted. My girlfriend took her car there to get fixed after my recommendation, and they treated her with the same friendly respect as they treated me. Recently I took our church van there, certain that it had seen it's last day, and they got it up and running at little cost and we used it for two youth retreats racking up over 1200 miles with no problems. I rarely write texts for companies online, but they really knocked my socks off.`,

        text: `My car broke down on the 93 on my way to work, I had to google local places near my home (no andover) and have my car towed there. Luckily, this place picked right up and agreed to take my car then and there, understanding my predicament. They were fast and efficient, my car completed within approximately 3 hours, I was up and running back to work! The mechanic took the time to show me what was going on under my hood (water pump broke which then stop distributing vital fluid to rest of the engine, which caused my car to over heat, air condition to fail, and all other parts to fail-temporarily thank goodness (except for the dip stick container)). I do not know anything about cars so I was happy that someone, who i believe was the owner, took the time to show me, get my car back, and not pretend my car needed more work than it did. At some point during the overheating, my dip stick holder broke (or burned through) also, the employee (or owner) had to locate this piece calling different places and I came back a week later to replace it. Again, my car was fixed within hours and I was back on the road. This was few months ago and no problems so far!`,
